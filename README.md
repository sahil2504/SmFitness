I'm very excited to share with you all a standalone web project that i was working on for the last 1 week, I have finally finished the frontend of the project and i am delighted to present it to you all. It's my fitness portfolio which i have made from scratch using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and BOOTSTRAP 4. I have majorly layed emphasis on the coding ethics layed down by W3C and made sure all my code is validated without any errors or warnings. I have built the site keeping in mind the accessibility of visually impaired users so the website's content is also well accessible using screen readers. I have added responsive design to the wepages hence they are responsive for different screen sizes and different devices and platforms.
